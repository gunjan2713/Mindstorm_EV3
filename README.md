INTRODUCTION

Our project, the Harmony Rover, revolves around the concept of merging robotics and music in a playful manner. The central idea was to craft a Lego Robot Car that is not only remotely controllable but also capable of creating musical melodies based on the colors it traverses. Our goal with this project is to exemplify the convergence of technology and art, allowing users to engage in a distinctive musical experience.
                             
  
2. 	MOTIVATION 
	The primary aim is to challenge conventional perspectives on robotics and music. By combining these two fields, the project seeks to create a joyful and exploratory experience for users, allowing them to interact with technology and art in a novel way. Beyond entertainment, the Harmony Rover is envisioned as a tool for sensory integration therapy. Its design and functionalities are intended to aid individuals in improving hand-eye coordination, precision, and overall motor skills. The incorporation of music and controlled movements offers therapeutic benefits, potentially aiding in cognitive skill enhancement, including memory, attention, and pattern recognition.


3. 	THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS

Encouraging users to engage in fine motor movements through its control mechanisms.
Utilising musical elements to enhance cognitive skills.
Offering a medium for improvisation and creative expression through its colour-to-music translation feature.
Facilitating movement to music, which can aid in developing coordination and dexterity.
These are just based on initial research and show that there is potential for development and incorporation in this aspect, indicating promising avenues for further exploration.

4. 	CHALLENGES
Initial Use of LEGO EV3: Our project initially started with the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit. However, we soon faced limitations since it was outdated and there was a lack of advanced software support. The color sensor in the EV3 kit was not performing as expected. It detected incorrectly, which impacted the functionality of our project where color detection was crucial. The speaker produced rough, low-quality sound. Its limitations in hardware and software capabilities restricted our ability to fully realise our projectâ€™s potential. Due to these challenges, we decided to transition from the LEGO EV3 to the LEGO SPIKE robot. The SPIKE robot offered more advanced features, better sensor accuracy, and superior sound quality, aligning better with the needs of our project.

Issue with Xbox Controller Integration: Another significant challenge we encountered was our attempt to use an Xbox controller to control the robot. Despite writing the entire code for this purpose, the integration failed. The primary issue was the incompatibility of the Xbox controller with our Mac setup, particularly the Bluetooth connectivity. This obstacle forced us to abandon the idea of using the Xbox controller. As a result, we had to pivot to using our smartphones for controlling the robot, which, although not our initial plan, provided an effective alternative control mechanism.

Coding Difficulties and Sound Integration Issues: A major challenge we faced was in the coding aspect of the project. Initially, the robot was only capable of producing simple beeps, falling short of our goal to integrate diverse instrumental sounds. Implementing the code to transform these basic beeps into a variety of instrumental sounds proved to be a complex task. We encountered numerous programming hurdles in trying to enhance the sound capabilities of the robot, making this one of the more demanding aspects of our project.


5. 	LIMITATIONS
Restricted Color Options with Mindstorms Software: Using the Mindstorms software constrained our choices in color detection. The software's limited palette meant we couldn't program the robot to recognize a wide range of colors, impacting the versatility of the color sensor's functionality.
Stability Issues During Quick Sideward Movements: The robot tends to fall over when turning sideways rapidly. This instability not only disrupts its movement but also interrupts the music playback, affecting the overall user experience and performance of the robot.
Single Distance Sensor Limitation: We were restricted to installing only one distance sensor, due to availability. This meant we could only equip the robot with obstacle detection on one side, reducing its ability to effectively sense and avoid obstacles from all directions.
Limited Instrument and Tempo Options on Joystick: The joystick was programmed to control only four different instrument sounds. This limitation in the number of assignable buttons restricted our ability to offer a more diverse range of musical interactions through the joystick, confining the auditory experience to just these four sounds.

6. WORKING
D-Pad Control for Movement: The robot car is equipped with a D-pad, featuring four buttons corresponding to four directions: forward, backward, and sideways (left and right). Each button on the D-pad is programmed to control the car's movement in its respective direction, offering precise and easy manoeuvrability.
Joystick with Instrumental Sounds: The joystick on the controller is uniquely integrated to produce different musical instrument sounds. It has four buttons, each assigned to a specific instrument sound. When a button is pressed, the corresponding instrument sound is played, adding an interactive musical element to the robot car's operation.

Dynamic Background Music Activation: As an added audio feature, the robot car initiates background music automatically when it starts moving. This music isn't just a single track but is layered with additional sounds such as choir or bass, enriching the auditory experience. It dynamically complements the movement of the car.
Color Sensor for Musical Notes: The robot car is equipped with a color sensor that detects different colors in its environment. Upon recognizing a specific color, the sensor triggers the car to produce a corresponding piano note. This feature adds an innovative and educational aspect to the robot, linking color recognition to musical sounds.
   
Ultrasonic Sensor: The robot car includes an ultrasonic sensor to prevent collisions. This sensor detects obstacles by using ultrasonic waves and automatically directs the car to stop.

                            
                                                

7. REFLECTION/EVALUATION	

This project was a significant learning journey, especially in adapting to unexpected challenges. Starting with the LEGO EV3 and transitioning to the SPIKE robot taught us the importance of flexibility and the ability to pivot when necessary. Working with different hardware and software broadened our understanding of robotics. Facing and overcoming various challenges, such as coding difficulties and hardware limitations, enhanced our problem-solving skills. Each obstacle presented an opportunity to delve deeper into the mechanics of coding and robotics, pushing us to find creative solutions. In our project, we often revisited and revised completed sections upon discovering more efficient solutions. This cycle of dismantling and incorporating improved ideas was challenging but crucial for innovation. It pushed us to strive for excellence, enhancing both the project and our problem-solving skills. Working on this project underscored the value of teamwork and collaboration. Both brought unique skills and perspectives, which was crucial in overcoming the challenges we faced. The exchange of ideas and support was a key factor in the project's progression.
The innovative aspects of the project and creative solutions to our problems were particularly satisfying, as they demonstrated our ability to incorporate complex features into the robot.


Reflecting on the project, there are areas for improvement. For instance, integrating the xbox controller and expanding the range of detectable colors would enhance its functionality. Additionally, exploring more advanced coding techniques could potentially resolve some of the sound integration issues we encountered.
Overall, the project was a rewarding experience. It not only bolstered our technical skills in robotics and programming but also nurtured our creativity and resilience.
